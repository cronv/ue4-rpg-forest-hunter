### Features
- We present to you our new game, developed using the visual scripting system Blueprints in Unreal Engine.
- Thanks to this approach, we were able to quickly implement all our ideas and mechanics.

### Important
Please note that the source code of the game cannot be provided, as the project was entirely created using Blueprints. Therefore, we cannot grant access to the source files in C++.
